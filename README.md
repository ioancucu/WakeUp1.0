# WakeUp1.0
AI for object detection and face recognition. <br>
**wuCollectAndLabel.py** --- is the testing file for video capture and labeling of some gesture like: thumbs up, thumbs down, live long, thank you.<br>
This will be used to train an AI to recognize these gestures from a webcam. <br>
This is only for learning purposes. <br>
After that AI will be trained on more complex problems.<br>
