# WakeUp1.0
AI for object detection and face recognition
wuCollectAndLabel.py --- is the testing file for video capture and labeling of some gesture like: thumbs up, thumbs down, live long, thank you.
This will be used to train an AI to recognize these gestures from a webcam. 
This is only for learning purposes. 
After that AI will be trained on more complex problems.
